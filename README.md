# SRIM-ATLAB
[SRIM](https://http://www.srim.org/) is a monte-carlo based simulation package, where more infomation about the software can be found on the SRIM website.

Please note this is very earlier so please use at your own peril. If you have any tips feel free to suggest changes.

The importing of simulation results into software for further post-processing is limited, hence this toolkit.
There is BASIC code that came with the package but I've never used basic and am not going to start.
Instead I'm writing a simple set of function for the files that I am using on a regular basis to import data from the interface into an enviroment where I can control variables.
